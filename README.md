# ossem: A Creative Space from 2018

This is an art project that I started in 2018 that assembled all my works up to this time. The efforts of which led me to the desire to search for a way to find a way to monetize my art.  This eventually culminated in my current project now, [starbeam.one](https://starbeam.one).

As mentioned this project was first published in 2018 under a previous psuedo/quasi-anonymn ossem.  I have since dropped that name in favor of my current one, Mike-E-angelo.  These works start from high school and go through 2019, when I started to build starbeam.one.

I have chosen to re-publish it for historical/sentimental value, but also to have a better idea of the artist who is suddenly running an art platform that is thankfully starting to show a little success.
