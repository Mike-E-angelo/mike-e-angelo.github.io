      <description>hands reached out the blue dances blindly around my fingertips around her. around us. I see her shining through through closed eyes. she smiles so peacefully on my bliss. traveling from fields of wandering green we hold each other forever. forever. the wind smiles on us too together we were meant to be. together with that harmony. this is some dance. she follows my lead. I know that this is where we are meant to be.</description>
