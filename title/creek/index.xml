      <description>It&amp;#39;s misty now. Outside. In here. Where there&amp;#39;s fear. Coating the lines of my Face. Bumping in the dark air. Sometimes. Light Finds its way. And I pass into the Flight of mind. Passing. Passing into my stare. They are memories now. And I wonder. Deeply. If what was meant to be. Passed into me. And here with mist in My hands. Rolling in my veins. These what once were. Passing into me.</description>
