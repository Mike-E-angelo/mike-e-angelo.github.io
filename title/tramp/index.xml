      <description>A god, Broken into billions of pieces. A piece is you. To gather the pieces isâ€¦ a clue. Are you a piece of me? Am I a piece of you? How do I see this piece of me? Where? Shattered. Assembled whole. Ocean images. You must show something for your efforts. Something. There are trysts in these parts. There are trusts, too. I have the karma divide. She is not very nice.</description>
