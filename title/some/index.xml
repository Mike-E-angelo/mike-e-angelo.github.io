      <description>She sort of is A Maenad The First. Dancing and talking On the Great Water Of life. And I, Well, I just watch. Scientifically. Artistically. Life-ly. I’m not sure what God she came from.	But she has my attention, now. For years now. And when she does dance. It’s to Her rhythm. I can’t help now But to keep her close. </description>

      <description>Dionysus. Where is bliss? Capping on your head? Such a diss. Mommy and Daddy would be so proud. But you. Make us. SUFFER! Dionysus. Where’s your bliss? Tucked inside your barren mistress. Here I slay. From boot to tower. Struck by. Mother. Suckle away. Ungrateful wench. I see your cause. Unto. Unto. Present. In your eyes. I hear your waking eyes. In your voice. Across the room. Beacons me. </description>
