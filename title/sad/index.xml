      <description>O harketh! Such a sad, sad day cometh! It IS heard. let us, me, fully embrace. the drink is sweet. yet taste is bitter! Such the sad, sad day Rises! Can it be toppled? it reigns the sons and daughters, me. echoes through the valleys makes the grass ShUdDeR. So much so, the pain. Such pain shatters. My existence, reality questioned. What lives of my being without such pain? O how such sad, sad days are suppressed.</description>
