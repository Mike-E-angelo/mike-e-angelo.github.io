      <description>There is a light that I see, only partially. I want it. how do I get it? one might ask me. i try, but it&amp;#39;s just out of reach. i hear a bell, love. i know not where it comes, but i want it please, i need help. can you see for me. a light shines and a bell rings, but is it for me? i feel it is, reaching for me, i can pull in, if i had the sight the moon, can i stand stand alone with it?</description>
