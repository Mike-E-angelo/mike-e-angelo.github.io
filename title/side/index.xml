      <description>With the monitors flickering upon his nearby, dark environment, Ron then wondered further that if the very reality that he is currently experiencing now is indeed a simulation of some sort &amp;ndash; with technology accelerating at a seemingly accelerating rate &amp;ndash; would it eventually culminate in the ability to accurately reflect the reality that Ron was in now?
The idea struck Ron. Is the reality that Ron finds himself in now a result of jumping into a technology or program that started in the same way as he is currently experiencing?</description>
