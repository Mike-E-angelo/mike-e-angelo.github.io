      <description>Thoughts and dreamsâ€¦ and mystery. She sings to me With Such Broken Promises. I cling to Her twisted stains. For my life. (in disbelief) In terror, I am Her puppet. In life, I am Her master. In troubled keep. I dance Her wake. I wrap myself in Her mistakes. For Her misery is my desire. A steadfast plan of mire. And desolate beauty. Seen. Lost in Her seams. I long for Her lonely glance.</description>
