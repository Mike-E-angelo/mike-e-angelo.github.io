      <description>can i see behind those lines?
it is hard. and it is
tricky to do.
i see to and want.
to know?
do you see me?
do you see behind this
curved line
on my head
that some
claim
a smile?
do you see that it&amp;rsquo;s a wince that makes my face that way.
do you see
that
pain that&amp;rsquo;s wedged within me.
Foolish! How could I have done this.</description>
