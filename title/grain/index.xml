      <description>Cherished Creator,
May You create in Us
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The World that is Yours
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Within Us
We bow now with wow
A bow wow for now.
In Your breathing essence
The stars stir with wonder
In Your high esteem
We beam a stately seam
May Your courtly desires
Praise that which is Noble and Pure
A high account of Heaven
Blessed be our ascent
Within Your blessed bough
Of might and brow</description>

      <description>my wrinkled shriveled carcass washes up
against her salty sand.
seeping into my cuts and sores,
her jagged rocks
rip and stretch my haggard meat.
and cut against my chipping bones.
on her sea of grains, crabs claw at my fingernails
they pull and tug until i snap with satisfaction.
birds,
once singing with our great harmony
now pick at my eyes with
infected beaks.
they clip the whites of my eyes</description>
