      <description>How do you dissolve nerousis? With a toothpick. Now, dance with me. I ain’t hitting that with a glass case. Now a vase. Heyyy! Get it! (alignment) Just being honest. Now, back to that honesty. Does it cost you? There’s a price, isn’t there? Watch the table. TH e table is ours. What do you see? A beautiful song. So not right. What do you hear? An anthem. Now we’re rockin’.</description>

      <description>Truth be told Strangely Unique. She sleeps beneath my wings. Under this rock. Protectorate. Beneath my underworld. Gathering the impending storm. So dark.	So vivid. It gathers. Gathering. Like woodwork. I stare at it. Like it’s an image. Stolen from my soul. These beats in my head. I wonder where they storm from. Is it honest to steal their Meaning? Sometimes. I feel I Speak in Circles. So Let’s pick an angle And get this party Started.</description>
