      <description>She stirs in the wind. She sits at my foot and we drift. In consecrated skies, we kiss. She is no home to me. She is so mean to me. Judged, on a half-steak makes me break. I ascend into Her calm. She takes me as I am. She is no savior. And when I commune with Her, Universes dissipate with Bright. She teaches how to hold my sword. And I learn how to make my word.</description>

      <description>As youâ€™re here. As I am. Once broken. Now I am. Broken Once. Broken Twice. Broken Narrow. Sacrifice. Once Sunday. Twice a Crowd. Here on Sunday. Break the Clouds. Your bread on Wednesday. Your blood is Mine. Sacrifice. Sacrifice. Here I stand on your Step. Make it Mine. Here I implore your Sacred vine. Some have sacred vows to store. Me, I have none to explore. Once Sunday. Once You. Once Sunday, Once you.</description>
