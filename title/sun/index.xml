      <description>I want to see your thick Unapology. I want to see your best In me. Supple. Lying. In this dark bliss. The caverness. Of unyielding. Wastedness. Your eyes. In candlelight. Remind me. Of stricken gold light. And that bracelet. So unforetold. The glimmering diamond. Can I be so bold? I wish your Cadaver. Could be examined. Placed in abandon. To dance with. And holding tight. Abounding might. When you see me.</description>
