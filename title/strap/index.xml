      <description>The phone call was simple enough. She called to thank me. It was an innocent, innocuous moment, but something told me that I had just encountered a significant point in my life. It was almost as if I had passed a great moral test of some sort. I never met her, but here she was, thanking me in broken English. “Thank you, Greg. Thank you.”
It was almost as if life itself, in some sort of twisted incarnation, was telling me something pivotal – something meaningful.</description>
