      <description>Chipper chapper. Let’s stop this right here. Isn’t this the same as the last? Twelve hours at a time is a long time To read minds. Isn’t it nice to be around people again? To what end? What’s your purpose. To me, Everyone Is poetry. Dancing energy. Your spirit is captured in me. You’re keeping note of names, I like that. Letters, spelling. A nice chat. On a sunny afternoon. The 10:10 would appreciate that.</description>
