      <description>Welcome to ossem, my creative space and art project. Here, you will find my writings and other works of art that I have created and collected over the years, along with other musings. I started this project in June of 2018, as it was my 42nd birthday on the 7th, and I had been exploring different blogging software around that time.
In particular, I had been exploring Hugo and it was nothing short of inspirational to me from a software design perspective.</description>
