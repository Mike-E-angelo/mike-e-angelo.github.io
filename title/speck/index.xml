      <description>She descends In winged dominance Over barren waters My fear is entranced Holy reverberations Mountains quiver. High-winged creatures clap Distanced, they circle Her air. Time caves in my space She cups my broken waste. I am packed meat in Her crusted cocoon. I cry Her wasted tear. Blue sky above and near. Salted demons dance On thirsted tongue. And now, in Her rigid rock-womb A bloody song is rung. Ears bleed forth Iâ€™ve lost sight of Her sun.</description>

      <description>With finality, the chair struck the bare wood floor. The air had no choice but to snap at first, but slowly it helped the chair down into oblivion. The weave of space and time undulated with a warm grace that offered a wishful eye and a careful stare of her newfound decision.
The creaking of the rope-spawn tendrils from high above tightened so sharply. Reverberations of past cries could only make their way into the current web of the room.</description>
