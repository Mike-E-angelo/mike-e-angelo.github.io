      <description>And there, exiting that bustling restaurant, Ray felt a certain sense deep within that he hadn’t felt for some time. In a way, he felt that he had been shifted in some way, some way deep inside.
His friends were well on their way to their cars, but Ray couldn’t help but to wonder if they themselves were touched in the same manner he was. It was as if their conversation had impacted him in a way that will be with him for the rest of his life, perhaps in the final days of death, when all who surround him are nameless unrecognizable creatures of care.</description>
