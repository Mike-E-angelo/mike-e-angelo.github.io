      <description>May Your stories ring clear and May I know which one to use At which time May those who wish to support us Be gainfully rewarded May their contributions be properly Bestowed and invested In manifold May they also be known in Full regard and call May they know their calling here By these words In past, present, and future May those who wish to contribute Continue to have patience May I know them by their words And subsequent actions May Your visions continue to Ring clear and with Heart May I accept and knead them within May You work with me in esteem and honor May Your Court be filled with praise to the end of days </description>
