      <description>And here. We are beautifully broken. So perfectly lost. How did we get here? So fairytale. A lost ship has sunk. From its coast, it dares not tell. Angels swoop upon the treasure. (it is their pleasure) Collect the gold. It’s greed, after all. Timeless classic. Pace a time’s forth. (are you in love again?) There is something to be bought. A price that is sought. There are stories to be won.</description>
