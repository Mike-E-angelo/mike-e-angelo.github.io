      <description>We are dark. We are deep. We are discrete. She leads me into the mystery. The misery. The ease. Sum of the parts. And the ton. Hash of the gold. Blue hush. Blinded by the metaled bye. Her harsh belt slighted a soft cheek. A family. Tumultuous. Second hindquadrant. Precious immigration. Disguise my blinded eye. She is here. In my clear. How do I hold you? The fear is real. Every night.</description>
