      <description>Will be times. Many times in my life. Where I will simply tone out. Zone out. It’s as if I’m the bell. And the window. It’s as if this is it.	This is all I have. And then I’m called back. A blink. A mystery. A challenge. And then it all seems so foolish. Second guessing. Neighborhooding. Bringing back the last days. Some days. These days. It’s not here. You wish.</description>
