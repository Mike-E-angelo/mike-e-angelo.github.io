      <description>these words.
do they have,
possess,
power?
some wish not.
some die so.
they must.
how could i explain
you
if they couldn&amp;rsquo;t.
idieSo.
they mean
everything to me.
yet they are only symbols.
but they are me.
can i not express myself
so openly. so profoundly.
i need this word. this
power.
and i need you.
too.
is that wrong, as well.
i die so.</description>
