      <description>Chained.
Behind blacked walls.
A screen appears.
She appears to me.
Human form.
Speaking. On authority.
And now, the quest begins.
An innerspace of wills.
To read the ether.
To provide the circumstance.
The mist dissolves in sunlight.
Tremendous bright.
Her energy radiates beauty.
Dissipating lock and key.
And here. In our time.
We play the tones of life.â€™
And wonder the keys and charms within.
Can I make this better?</description>
