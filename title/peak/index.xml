      <description>troubled waters float this raft
from so long ago
sweetened stars from above
dance merrily below
her eyes, so beautiful
so glowing
mean everything to me
I reach for her countenance
to help balance these unbalanced
mountains in my mind
where she believed and others beamed
so callously behind
that smile
that smile
wondrous flare and charming aware
can only make me believe
I believe in her
I believe in us</description>
