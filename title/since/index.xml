      <description>Something happened in the valley.
The strange, and derelict.
There are the words to say, to convey.
A passing mind’s eye, a mighty shift.
Tapestries are folded, in the flock of fools,
Sewn together by raging stools.
An adventure cut short, only to be abounded,
And hounded, by pride and envy.
A nature’s wrath comes full force,
Only to beg for mercy.
A time’s unwind, through space and twine,
These are the mystery’s take, through due wine.</description>
