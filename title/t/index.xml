      <description>To give carely. To receive bountifully. We are the psychology of you. And us. The aisles of contempt. And anguish. Your Love is here. Be clear. The trips of dreams In me. The obsession of wealth. The obsession of Time. The trips within me Are beam. A smoky horizon, Breeding impermanence. A dangerous occupation. In the flesh, You’re letting your work run in. The work runs in within I’ll trail after that.</description>
