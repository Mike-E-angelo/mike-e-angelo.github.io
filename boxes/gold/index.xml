      <description>May my timing be appropriate and crisp
According to Your will
May Your animals be swift and decisive
Mightily dodging Sofia’s tread
May these furry fellas miss us
May my braking be prudent and sure
May their appropriate signs be taken
And understood and received accordingly
May these signs never result in any death, injury
Or damage
May I also be kindly reminded to further
Not to partake of the death of animals in my</description>

      <description>If I cajole, coerce, condescend, disparage, intimidate Another human spirit in attempt to somehow gain the minds, approval, or liking of others Then I have already lost If respect is not shown in a way that reflects and acknowledges My own self in another person’s bone and skin, Having lived such a life as mine with a completely different set of results and perspective Then I have already lost If I try to dominate the indomitable The fellow wild human spirit that runs as free as Nature Itself with me Then I have already lost If I don’t welcome your contrarian view Which illuminates the side of my prey – our prey that which was yet unseen, unknown, and different to me Then I have already lost If I meet your perceived disrespect With my own in actual intent To prove that I am somehow more “right” or “found” than you Then I have already lost </description>

      <description>Cherished Creator,
May You create in Us
 The World that is Yours
Within Us
We bow now with wow
A bow wow for now.
In Your breathing essence
The stars stir with wonder
In Your high esteem
We beam a stately seam
May Your courtly desires
Praise that which is Noble and Pure
A high account of Heaven
Blessed be our ascent
Within Your blessed bough
Of might and brow</description>

      <description>Strung along gilded hopes And dreams and visions of past There is some angel in these eyes (and the Bright) Reigned for days by spells and lies Oh, these broken, jeweled moons No no, it’s far too soon (the move) Yes, I have shed the Dark and the Shadow. And on the Straits, I crucified Her on the gallows Somewhere beyond Golgotha and Gomorrah She hung high and seaside With four others, screaming wide “HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?</description>
