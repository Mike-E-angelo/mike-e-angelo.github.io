      <description>Have you ever. felt? The wind from. a thirsty. barren. wasteland. flow over you? like a disease that won&amp;#39;t decay. then notice. out of nowhere. you&amp;#39;re there!	in the wasteland. looking staring at the void. the dunes of hollow. wondering what was once there. by then, it happens? you notice. You are the wasteland. spewing your wicked, decaying, breath. wind. on others. does this stop? will it end? the wind is speechless.</description>

      <description>O harketh! Such a sad, sad day cometh! It IS heard. let us, me, fully embrace. the drink is sweet. yet taste is bitter! Such the sad, sad day Rises! Can it be toppled? it reigns the sons and daughters, me. echoes through the valleys makes the grass ShUdDeR. So much so, the pain. Such pain shatters. My existence, reality questioned. What lives of my being without such pain? O how such sad, sad days are suppressed.</description>

      <description>can i see behind those lines?
it is hard. and it is
tricky to do.
i see to and want.
to know?
do you see me?
do you see behind this
curved line
on my head
that some
claim
a smile?
do you see that it&amp;rsquo;s a wince that makes my face that way.
do you see
that
pain that&amp;rsquo;s wedged within me.
Foolish! How could I have done this.</description>

gone.

      <description>these words.
do they have,
possess,
power?
some wish not.
some die so.
they must.
how could i explain
you
if they couldn&amp;rsquo;t.
idieSo.
they mean
everything to me.
yet they are only symbols.
but they are me.
can i not express myself
so openly. so profoundly.
i need this word. this
power.
and i need you.
too.
is that wrong, as well.
i die so.</description>
