      <description>May my timing be appropriate and crisp
According to Your will
May Your animals be swift and decisive
Mightily dodging Sofia’s tread
May these furry fellas miss us
May my braking be prudent and sure
May their appropriate signs be taken
And understood and received accordingly
May these signs never result in any death, injury
Or damage
May I also be kindly reminded to further
Not to partake of the death of animals in my</description>

      <description>Cherished Creator,
May You create in Us
 The World that is Yours
Within Us
We bow now with wow
A bow wow for now.
In Your breathing essence
The stars stir with wonder
In Your high esteem
We beam a stately seam
May Your courtly desires
Praise that which is Noble and Pure
A high account of Heaven
Blessed be our ascent
Within Your blessed bough
Of might and brow</description>

      <description>To Apollo, the god of strength and truth, from whom I learned the power of taking quiet solitude and the well-rounded value of keeping a well-formed opinion to one’s self. From a great many precepts, you taught me how to find and discern the many sides of an issue, while reserving judgement for only when it is absolutely required. To you, I am indebted to learning patience and fortitude, to understanding the harmonious workings of nature and man, and to keeping such courtesies within the realm of my consciousness.</description>
