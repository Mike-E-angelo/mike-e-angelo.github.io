The king of my own very canal.
	A thought
Impulse.
	A derision.
		Cloudy thoughts.
		Enter the mindtrain.
The purity of extra thought.
Loud and clear.
		An extra ear.
		Of yours.
No way are you here.
No way.
	Strike my hand.  Will it bleed.
		Surface cut.

		If there is a problem here,
			I …
		Chasm of pronouncement.
	There’s this angle.  And this image.
		And then…
A great thought over here.
	And you keep churning.  Over and over.
Until you get it.
	And once you do..
	Well, that’s an entirely different problem
		Altogether.
Let’s just keep on talking.
		On and on.
		A prince leaps on failure.
		A simpleton bows under pressure.
	These two are..
		Stomping toads in the mind’s eye.
Is that the riddle?
	If a riddle was placed in front of you,
	I’d have to question the purpose of that riddle
		In the first place.  It’s not very nice, after all.
A pair of swans.  Perpendicular.
	Where did those beams come from?
		And to be.. so.. cosmic?
		How did they affect you so very dearly?
		Square beaks.  And they were definitely epic.
			Let’s not kid ourselves.
				Everyone saw it.
Case in point:
	Something on your jaw?
	Not a southpaw.
		The crowd dilapidates.
		Sweat expedites.
	I’m sorry… ,y partner is… clueless.
			I’m pretty sure we were both
q				In the cold this time.
	OK second verse.  I get it.  You all are very particular.
No. No.  Third verse.  Alright.  Want me to punch right?  Let’s say I do?  Bring that mother.
	I have one here who is in a commercial.
	I have one who is in articles.
I’m sure they are in their very own shockwaves.
Let’s check their hair.
Let’s not go there.
	She checked with us.  Did she?
	You’re out of your mind.
		Clean your presence gentlemen.
				Royalty is upon us.  And royalty they shall receive.
				Don’t you have a question?
			Yes sir.
			Where will you lead us?
		When was the last time you checked an oyster?
			In the mouth?
Well, sir, oysters are living creatures and I don’t wish to disturb their natural habitat.
	Sometimes the water needs a swingbrush to get its attention.
Soldier, if you swing in the water and a hairbrush is needed…
	Sir..
Meanwhile, in a second quadrant.		..
Call her and get this over with.
				Everything is compacted at this point.
