We are deep.
		We are discrete.
She leads me into the mystery.
	The misery.

			The ease.
Sum of the parts.  And the ton.
		Hash of the gold.
	Blue hush.

Blinded by the metaled bye.
Her harsh belt slighted a soft cheek.

		A family.
	Tumultuous.

Second hindquadrant.
Precious immigration.

		Disguise my blinded eye.
		She is here.
			In my clear. How do I hold you?
	The fear is real.
		Every night.  Every angle.
			And angel.

	Hold my black water.  Hold it dear.  I’ve seared the far corners.
Thank you.  Sometimes I forget the good times and remember the bad.
And all the things between us, I wish we had.
Many a time I have wished us to be bold and sunblocked.
In this, the caverned wishblock.
We have held true.

	We have held blue.
	The corners have faded away.

In the water you hold.  Of mine.
So black and pure.

I’ve wondered upon its tantrum.
I wish it gone.

		So gone.
		Alive.
	If you are not here with me.
		Then there is not then.
		And if not then, not us;
Not us, not it.

			You have my black.
			I will never need it back.
			The black is the need.
			And dangerous; I wouldn’t wish it upon
				Anyone but you.
				I wish you’d take it and
				Make me a fool.
			Hearted and departed.  Expressionless.
Started without pretense.
Dreaming in school
		I would be.
		A majesty.
			Something in the sums
			Of nothing.

				I beat the drums of nothing.

				And yet.  It and they arrive.
				
				Hardened and wardened.

			Awakened and stirred.  I wish your peace in me.
			And us.  We can make it.  I pray every morning.
To you.  I know you feel me.  I feel you.
	The swelling of promise and cliché.
	It is a partay.  And I will make it right.

A twelve step promise and fortitude.  I have guides.
And you.

A swept current and placement.
We stir
		And weep.
In your keep.

			Tempted.
		Swept.</pre></div>
