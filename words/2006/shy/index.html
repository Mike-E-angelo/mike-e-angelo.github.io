Hot white
		Starlight
She doesn’t blink
seem
		Hm.					
To me.
Trouble is				let’s talk a while.
Trouble does.
	Somewhere in 		pull up a chair		
Here.						pull your hair
		This pasture.	
					Her eyes are…
									
Did she just say that?	
	What is this that I just found myself in…
Seems dark
	And bright
At the same time.					Well that was that.  It is what it is.
									Telltale mysteries come to me.
Black, is it?  Suits you well.
Let’s keep it that way.			Trouble is.imintrouble
Dark is appealing, sometimes.
					*spark*
uhhh …&lt;-- closely					ya, I know what that was.
					I’ve felt that before.
	Well now, I’ll just sit here
And pay attention.						Circle you. Slo-wly
	Well now, I feel
I just played my cards.
		Let’s play a new hand.			Perhaps it’s best to let it rest.
				Crescent moon behind my head.
								Ah yes, you 
speak in code.
									Well well,
Aren’t we in good company				???
	I’ve spent many moons
		Speaking this one.

					The more the merrier, so they say.

							Nice choice of numbers.
							Now you’re speaking my language. 

				There’s someone 
I want you to meet.
Across from me.
	She waits for it.		Too plainly.
Somewhere in here.
			I dig deep to find		clairvoyant mystiques within me.
										1/64th you know…
That little sound trickling			so fondly.
What here is now.
Now somewhere within the lucidity of modernity.

		Now wait just a second.
				Don’t ask me THAT.  Where are 
your manners?										Shame on you.
								We both know the answer to that one.
More questions than answers.					The mirror seems a little distorted 
right now.				But that’s for necessity.
(from)
			A little request with this little 
Head of mine.
			Lucid?  Perhaps another 
Tuesday night visit 
is in store...
Perhaps I’ll dream of 			Her
This time.
