      <description>What does it mean to take a knee? Will you watch it with me? There’s a deeper meaning in Everything that we do. A correspondence. A coalescence. When you sit there. And test the boundaries of others. There’s a certain prospect. Of rejection. When this rejection becomes part of you. You stand upon a pedestal of Perspective. When this perspective has sat upon you. You know your place. Now then, Let us continue?</description>

Shifting Netherlands.

And then her.

I awake in a bloody escape.
Where does her slithering organ end?
Not a friend. Here everything
is below board.
Soaring before.

Full tilt as the sidewalk
Melts between us
Dirty devils steal one of us
She&amp;rsquo;s a sidearm
And her arm is a
Bandolier
Of crazy years
Some say She dissipates
Crazy 8&amp;rsquo;s
Oh no stay away
She has this mighty fine stack
Of powder
Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to be Her
But I know I know I&amp;rsquo;ll be on
On that porch soon
Kicking off my shoes.
She dances blind within</description>

      <description>Here I am Dancing in the wilderness. This secret is clutched in my grasps. I swing wildly with my right foot. I pound slightly with my left foot. They each sing the others’ praise. The dust swirls with such high regard. The long tail of wind directs beige perspective. A mound forms beneath, To the side, And on the top of its side, A cacophonoph approaches I find the right swings under me, The left swoops in front.</description>

      <description>I want to see your thick Unapology. I want to see your best In me. Supple. Lying. In this dark bliss. The caverness. Of unyielding. Wastedness. Your eyes. In candlelight. Remind me. Of stricken gold light. And that bracelet. So unforetold. The glimmering diamond. Can I be so bold? I wish your Cadaver. Could be examined. Placed in abandon. To dance with. And holding tight. Abounding might. When you see me.</description>

      <description>When I walk her at 2AM. I feel at peace. In harmony. I resonate. When I walk her at 3AM. I am a paper sentinel. With a paper sword. When I walk her at 4AM. Her dew dresses my garment. I am at one. With this animal. We ride. I sing her discord. I wave her glee. And down her concrete stakes and wooden slabs. Along her many miles of pressed visions.</description>

      <description>When she closes her Mind’s eye She forgets her past. And everything. Caught in a twisted dream. I account for Her. It’s a broken mindset. But broken things Are meant to be fixed. Shifted asylum. Her heart is astray A wicked wonder. Hearing her voice again. Handshake left, and right. Are we in your crew? A crew of risk. Typing desk. Her eyes hold the sunlight Of a million moons. It’s a click on that door.</description>

      <description>When I go into the depths of those Eyes It is like a mist And there’s this hum In my head.	There’s this brilliance. A dancing Sun. And I touch her skin. Just wanting to win. Somewhere in this Darkened Dance room. Her hips Roam with mine. Entwined. Dangerously. She tells me it’s a new day We’ll wait and see. She compliments me.	Heavily. A tear to my eye. I won’t deny.</description>

      <description>Truth be told Strangely Unique. She sleeps beneath my wings. Under this rock. Protectorate. Beneath my underworld. Gathering the impending storm. So dark.	So vivid. It gathers. Gathering. Like woodwork. I stare at it. Like it’s an image. Stolen from my soul. These beats in my head. I wonder where they storm from. Is it honest to steal their Meaning? Sometimes. I feel I Speak in Circles. So Let’s pick an angle And get this party Started.</description>

I pronounce Her Alive Ignited In Her ring Of flickering chaos. Wonder. I find Her bliss. She Smiles. Deep. One step too far. Never said. Never stated. She whispers selective patterns. I listen. But. The angle of my motioned feet.</description>
