      <description>And there, walking along side of the parking building, Roger knew he was about to taste destiny.
Roger was on his way to pick up some friends for the night out. They lived in a busy part of downtown. People lined the streets one either side, causing traffic to snarl its way throughout. Roger had just parked his car in the parking structure to the right of him and was on his way to his friends’ apartment two blocks south.</description>

      <description>and there, skin to skin our destinies pinned and there, traveled sadness residual quickness and there, something familiar stirs within us and there, something plain weaves throughout us and there, souls connect barren contact and there, I feel you read me you’ll never finish me and there, something amiss sudden, sullen abyss and here, once dancing in doubt I have finally figured you out</description>

      <description>Troubled seas in those dreams
Of hers.
And I see them. So alive
In me.
Harrowed response.
Sloppy sour.
She floats. I see it.
She drifts. I feel it.
That smile is so cracked and
Twisted.
Only soft memories fly with me.
Hallowed sunlight.
Take flight
With her.
Must I once again
Drown in her waters.
Scorpio passing
Gemini drowning.</description>

      <description>And there, exiting that bustling restaurant, Ray felt a certain sense deep within that he hadn’t felt for some time. In a way, he felt that he had been shifted in some way, some way deep inside.
His friends were well on their way to their cars, but Ray couldn’t help but to wonder if they themselves were touched in the same manner he was. It was as if their conversation had impacted him in a way that will be with him for the rest of his life, perhaps in the final days of death, when all who surround him are nameless unrecognizable creatures of care.</description>

      <description>And when Jon finished wiping the mirror with that dampened hand-towel of his, he felt that somehow his life had changed. Something deep within that mirror struck back at him. There wasn’t a familiar reflection that lived within the mirror this morning. No, this morning Jon saw the very thing that looked back at him. He couldn’t help but to look back. It called into him to stare it in the eyes.</description>

      <description>And it was there with those eyes that George knew he made his mistake. Looking around with all these strangers, he could only grasp his memory by mere threads. How did he get here? Where were his friends? Where was he?
So many people bristled at his presence in that old rusted house, the muffled music made him confused on whether he should be happy or sad. People stopped briefly in the hallway to dispense somewhat honest conversations.</description>

      <description>hollowed shining ringing her echoes she refines that which is there forever entwined and enwrapped and furrowed and programmed within the great divide until we know how long it is with the other side, I won’t know and that sort of scares the essence of spirited debate and heart and how can that know if I don’t know the essence of me. search and search and search I may wander aimlessly are you ok with that?</description>

      <description>hands reached out the blue dances blindly around my fingertips around her. around us. I see her shining through through closed eyes. she smiles so peacefully on my bliss. traveling from fields of wandering green we hold each other forever. forever. the wind smiles on us too together we were meant to be. together with that harmony. this is some dance. she follows my lead. I know that this is where we are meant to be.</description>

      <description>there’s wild water in that brown-eyed whirlwind I must confess, if it were any differently I would rescind. my sails will snag upon her force but I know it won’t take me far. for I have only traveled these waters mapped by other stars. troubled waters in a different time troubled waters these will be mine she’ll dash me further than I’ve been before. she’ll throw me further than my plans in store.</description>

      <description>one by one she pops the stars in my eyes in the needle goes slowly through my brown skies a prick a stick wincing yet grinning she twists that needle so true and straight watching me squirm without much debate I kick and yell and beg for more I yearn to know what she has in store I barter for her pain like a fool taking me to her school excrement in her stool I smell like a fat fool with a little drool spin that metal how I jerk in glee.</description>

      <description>my wrinkled shriveled carcass washes up
against her salty sand.
seeping into my cuts and sores,
her jagged rocks
rip and stretch my haggard meat.
and cut against my chipping bones.
on her sea of grains, crabs claw at my fingernails
they pull and tug until i snap with satisfaction.
birds,
once singing with our great harmony
now pick at my eyes with
infected beaks.
they clip the whites of my eyes</description>

      <description>fettered quickly upon her barren shores I know what’s best for her and her smile sinking quickly beneath me. she sings a song I do not know or have never heard. what’s to know about her? about us? fine day for a matinee. I say. surely in the quick of dawn. we are one chances are we. chances are we. chances are we. who said we never owe a creature&amp;#39;s stow perchance it’s happenstance.</description>

A flurry it yields. Where it stops. Only I know. For you’re in my sling. My witty ride. My complex side. Slide and twist. Isn’t this fun? Squirm and yell. Are you done?</description>
