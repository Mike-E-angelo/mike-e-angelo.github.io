      <description>So far away
The sun beams
Steal us away
In concrete gutters
We skip and play
So wasted
You sell houses
And I am a wealthy
Prospective buyer
We stroll down heavy
Streets and look over
Cobble-stone driveways
Maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll find a match
And will live happily ever
After and after
Oh look a church
How saintly and
Majestic
Shelled in stained glass
We walk around but
Do not enter</description>

      <description>Encased in Her desire
I am dressed in Mire.
Second-face
Throughport
Who has second center?
Would you like to sleep?
Essence, pre-absorbed.
She’s in my hind-center.
Images are cheap
A dozen, so to speak.
A mouthpiece is necessary
Will you marry me?
The secret is out
Without a doubt.
And a stop goes to
A cottonmouth.
No play
To this day
We are in the south
Don’t bounce.</description>

      <description>Do you hear the sway
Of guns and heart
Of wishes and mantles
Of death and start.</description>

      <description>when the lovers dance
And are swept by
Guiding glances of
Sad sunlight
The gods simple mocking
Of afternoon pleasures
Holidays that are never
Realized.
They
Came to stay. Led astray.
They
Lie awake. Stranded takes.
Misty ghosts dance upon
Misty houses broken down
They laugh and flee.
There is no glee.
A coward&amp;rsquo;s paradise.</description>

      <description>This is my notebook.
There are many like this one.
But this one is mine.
With this notebook.
I can alight realms.
And destroy a people.
I am a fleshy weight
Bundled in tome.</description>

      <description>She breathes in my opposite Counterbearing to my darewit, She billows in gallows far from me. And I, in esteem, carry streets of dreams Collective arms and nations. Breathe. I am the ends of me. D96 Premonitions are not unlost. We peer into the sanctuary. We are in the posthaste mortuary. Songs are written, foes are beaten. Adversaries tell the tale, warriors ring the bell. Short-timers sell, Cretans foretell. An ocean for a lover, Conscious compromise.</description>

      <description>She stirs in the wind. She sits at my foot and we drift. In consecrated skies, we kiss. She is no home to me. She is so mean to me. Judged, on a half-steak makes me break. I ascend into Her calm. She takes me as I am. She is no savior. And when I commune with Her, Universes dissipate with Bright. She teaches how to hold my sword. And I learn how to make my word.</description>

      <description>When She kisses my moonlight, I hide in burrowed screams. And I, in my own light. Know Her sunbeams. My worthless plight of day. Her might of play. Taunting. The Earth bends below Her. It sings joyed terror. And I, in my dance. Lurch in acquiesce. Stupidity rinses my strength away. Down such a gloried fade. Days of promise seem so far away. No angels stand near. Knocks of wine. Colors spin so fine.</description>

      <description>To give carely. To receive bountifully. We are the psychology of you. And us. The aisles of contempt. And anguish. Your Love is here. Be clear. The trips of dreams In me. The obsession of wealth. The obsession of Time. The trips within me Are beam. A smoky horizon, Breeding impermanence. A dangerous occupation. In the flesh, You’re letting your work run in. The work runs in within I’ll trail after that.</description>
