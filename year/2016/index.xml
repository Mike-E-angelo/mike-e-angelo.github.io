      <description>Something happened in the valley.
The strange, and derelict.
There are the words to say, to convey.
A passing mind’s eye, a mighty shift.
Tapestries are folded, in the flock of fools,
Sewn together by raging stools.
An adventure cut short, only to be abounded,
And hounded, by pride and envy.
A nature’s wrath comes full force,
Only to beg for mercy.
A time’s unwind, through space and twine,
These are the mystery’s take, through due wine.</description>

      <description>Still, the subtle scent of tobacco in the air snapped at the tip of Roger&amp;rsquo;s nose. It made him nervous somehow, but he managed to keep his composure. He could tell by the way his clothes were sticking to his body it had to have been about 4a.m. But you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell that by the scenery around him. Life abounded. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite sure how he got here, or even which hotel he was in.</description>
