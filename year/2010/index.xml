      <description>She has Weltered walls. Shattering along Her weighted depth. Lighting dashes above. My shadow. Cascades. On Her metal Skin. I pull myself. Sword in hand. Up. Shattered. Wailing light. With careless effort, She Laughs at me. I push Up. She crashes around me. My rusted nails bite into her wasted root. I know I’m not the first. My own armored skin weighs me down. With great flair she brushes And shrugs.</description>

      <description>Look at all this green.
Like a wall.
Like a fortress.
Boxed in.
So green.
So close.
And the chirps.
Chipper-chirper.
I count 5 birds.
2 here.
3 there.
This one over here stops when I walk this way.
This one over here stops when I listen too closely.
Like an old-skool hunter.
I read the Ether by chirp.
Now I sing with my new friends.
Mimic this one. I can do the tonality.</description>

      <description>A little idea I had back in the day. Does the Earth speak to us in notes?</description>

i only watch
and wait
what will she do

and i just watch
and wait
what will i do
next

      <description>You speak to me
In such soft
Visions.
Slowly
Forming
Spines
Splining from the light
Here. Within.
Fire in my eyes.
I know You’re here.
Storm in my ears.
Peace.
Sacred land.
I dance on You.
Screaming. Rapture.
Ashes burned on
The corners of my bones.
Embracing
Subtle wonders.
Placing sacrifice.
Enraging demons from
Afar.</description>

      <description>She sort of is A Maenad The First. Dancing and talking On the Great Water Of life. And I, Well, I just watch. Scientifically. Artistically. Life-ly. I’m not sure what God she came from.	But she has my attention, now. For years now. And when she does dance. It’s to Her rhythm. I can’t help now But to keep her close. </description>

      <description>Some wicked caves behind me.
Sifting.
Barren lakes.
Woodened souls.
Pour.
Shadows clatter.
Casting light.
On all of me.
And here now.
Gravel in knees.
At Her altar.
Ten points of light.
Skyward towards Her singing embrace.
She slowly tugs at the Acorn
From inside.
Peering.
Branches unfurling.
Leaves
Within, I feel Her.
Once again.</description>
