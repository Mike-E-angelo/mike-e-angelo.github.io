      <description>Will you not let me be?
(Causal factions)
And if we are not here.
(not in the clear).
It’s not often we are here.
And when I lose the spot we were in,
I become unglued.
The Saints are not happy
With how I play the game.
But to me, it’s all the same.
Battlefields are won with
Patience and poise.
Not reckless noise.
We make a life out of mystery</description>

      <description>We are dark. We are deep. We are discrete. She leads me into the mystery. The misery. The ease. Sum of the parts. And the ton. Hash of the gold. Blue hush. Blinded by the metaled bye. Her harsh belt slighted a soft cheek. A family. Tumultuous. Second hindquadrant. Precious immigration. Disguise my blinded eye. She is here. In my clear. How do I hold you? The fear is real. Every night.</description>

      <description>Where hare you?
Are you in the blue.
Are you here in the stead.
Are you here in my head.
I feel the taste.
Electric paste.
The moment between moments.
A calm buzz.
A careening presumption.
A black white hum.
Subtle space.
Can you feel me?
It’s a special space.
A 12 step process.
Five planting.
7 climbing.
Somewhere it is there.
I wear it briefly.
A sudden god.</description>

      <description>She speaks in soft whispers
And I take the messages from
It
And place the binding in you.
Here
She rests in Peace
And confounding bliss
Spires of beauty
Entwined in me.
She’s a part of you, too.
An awkward tirade of sorts
She conspires agenda.
To what was.
What once will be.
Her pleasure is yours.
Will you not act
Upon your time.
I will not.
Singular or not.</description>
